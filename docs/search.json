Including multiple versions introduces: - Redundancy - Confusion in grouping industries or occupations - Risk of double-counting or misalignment in trend analysis\n\n\nWe retained only the most recent version of each code to ensure consistency and relevance to 2024 labor market trends.\n\n\n\n\nCleaning the dataset in this way improves our analysis by:\n\nReducing noise: Fewer columns means clearer signals\nImproving interpretability: Analysts and readers can focus on current classifications\nEnhancing visualizations: Charts and tables are easier to read and more meaningful\nEnsuring consistency: Aligns with external sources like Lightcast and BLS data\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a cleaner dataset, we’re now ready to explore key workforce themes—such as AI-driven job growth, salary disparities, and gender-based employment patterns—using reliable, streamlined data."

Rather than analyzing trends from a recruiter’s perspective, our team approached this challenge as future professionals navigating a landscape shaped by AI adoption, remote work, shifting salary norms, and gender-based employment patterns.Using real-world data from Lightcast and other labor market sources, we applied data science, analytics, and visualization techniques to investigate key workforce themes. Our goal was to uncover actionable insights that inform personal career planning and highlight the skills most in demand across industries. This website presents our findings, reflections, and recommendations—designed not only to fulfill academic objectives, but to serve as a practical roadmap for anyone preparing to enter or pivot within today’s dynamic job market."
