⚠️ Note for teammates:
Both `data_analysis.qmd` and `data_cleaning.qmd` exist. 
Our Quarto site currently uses **data_cleaning.qmd** for rendering (see `_quarto.yml`). 
Do not delete files — we’ll consolidate once the team aligns.

data/ is now ignored to avoid GitHub’s 100 MB limit. Keep large CSVs in data/ locally and don’t commit them. Pages load from data/ at render time. If you need the class dataset, place it at data/job_postings_2024.csv (or use our flexible loader).
