#  Data Cleaning Overview

In this section, we outline key decisions made during the data preprocessing phase, focusing on column relevance, code redundancy, and the impact on downstream analysis.

---

##  Identifying Irrelevant or Redundant Columns

After reviewing the dataset, we identified several columns that were either:

- **Irrelevant** to our analysis goals (e.g., internal IDs, timestamps not tied to labor trends)
- **Redundant** due to duplication or overlapping information

###  Examples of Columns Removed:
- `record_id`, `submission_timestamp`: Metadata not used in analysis
- `naics_code_2017`, `naics_code_2022`: Multiple versions of the same classification system
- `soc_code_2010`, `soc_code_2018`: Legacy codes that overlap with updated versions

##  Why Remove Multiple Versions of NAICS/SOC Codes?

::: {.callout-note}
**NAICS (North American Industry Classification System)** and **SOC (Standard Occupational Classification)** codes are updated periodically. Including multiple versions introduces:
- Redundancy
- Confusion in grouping industries or occupations
- Risk of double-counting or misalignment in trend analysis
:::

We retained only the **most recent version** of each code to ensure consistency and relevance to 2024 labor market trends.

##  How This Improves Analysis

Cleaning the dataset in this way improves our analysis by:

-  **Reducing noise**: Fewer columns means clearer signals
-  **Improving interpretability**: Analysts and readers can focus on current classifications
-  **Enhancing visualizations**: Charts and tables are easier to read and more meaningful
-  **Ensuring consistency**: Aligns with external sources like Lightcast and BLS data

##  Next Steps

With a cleaner dataset, we’re now ready to explore key workforce themes—such as AI-driven job growth, salary disparities, and gender-based employment patterns—using reliable, streamlined data.
