# Data-Driven Career Analysis: Evaluating Personal Job Market Prospects in 2025

## Introduction

The global job market continues to transform rapidly as artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and data-driven decision-making redefine how organizations hire and grow talent. This project investigates the **intersections of Business Analytics (BA), Data Science (DS), and Machine Learning (ML)** roles to uncover which skills, experiences, and qualifications drive the strongest career outcomes in 2025.  

Using labor market data from **Lightcast**, combined with additional references from **Bureau of Labor Statistics** and contemporary academic research, this study explores salary trends, remote work patterns, and skill demand shifts across key industries [@lightcast2024labor; @bls2024wages; @bone2025skills].

## Rationale

The rapid diffusion of AI and data technologies has elevated the need for specialized technical and analytical expertise across nearly every sector [@makela2024complement]. Organizations are increasingly adopting **skill-based hiring** practices over traditional degree-based approaches, emphasizing applied technical proficiency, adaptability, and digital literacy.  

This analysis helps future professionals — especially graduate students and early-career analysts — understand how **specific skills, tools, and experience levels** influence employability, compensation, and growth opportunities. By evaluating current job postings, we highlight where the market is heading and how individuals can strategically position themselves in this evolving environment.

## Literature Insights

Recent studies emphasize the dual importance of technical and human skills.  
- **Bone et al. (2025)** found that employers increasingly prioritize demonstrable competencies (e.g., Python, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing) over academic credentials for AI-related jobs.  
- **Mäkela & Stephany (2024)** observed that AI technologies often **complement rather than replace** human labor, boosting demand for creativity, communication, and problem-solving alongside data skills.  
- **McKinsey (2022)** further noted that remote work and digital collaboration are now embedded in the modern work structure, influencing salary and flexibility expectations.

Together, these insights form the foundation for our exploratory and predictive modeling analyses, which examine how specific skills translate into measurable labor market value.

## Project Structure

The website is organized into analytical sections reflecting the end-to-end data science workflow:

| Section | Focus | Deliverable |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Data Cleaning** | Preprocessing and text normalization using PySpark | Cleaned dataset (lightcast_cleaned.csv) |
| **EDA** | Visual and statistical exploration of salary, experience, and skill trends | Interactive Plotly charts |
| **Skill Gap Analysis** | Group-level skill self-assessment vs. market demand | Heatmaps and skill frequency analysis |
| **Machine Learning Methods** | Regression, clustering, and classification to predict salary and job segmentation | Feature importance and actionable insights |
| **Personal Career Strategy** | Team reflections and professional development plans | Individualized career roadmaps |

Each component builds toward a comprehensive view of the labor market — connecting data preparation, modeling, and practical application.
