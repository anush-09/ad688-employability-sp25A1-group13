# Team Dataframe

Our team conducted  an overview of our current technical skills when it comes to Business Analytics and our skill levels. The goal was to understand where the group's strengths and weaknesses were, and understand how the data that was collected could relate to the data that was observed in the research conducted. This was used to identify strengths and weaknesses for the group while also identifying potential gaps within the group.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Extended skills data
skills_data = {
    "Name": ["Anu", "Cindy", "Gavin"],
    "Data Analysis": [5, 4, 4],
    "Python": [3, 3, 3],
    "SQL": [5, 3, 2],
    "Machine Learning": [2, 2, 2],
    "Cloud Computing": [3, 3, 2],
    "Power BI": [3, 5, 3],
    
}

# Create DataFrame and set index
df_skills = pd.DataFrame(skills_data).set_index("Name")

# Ensure all columns are numeric
df_skills = df_skills.apply(pd.to_numeric)

# Add the Average row
df_skills["Average"] = df_skills.mean(axis=1)

# Style with borders and centered text
df_styled = df_skills.style.set_table_styles([
    {'selector': 'th, td', 'props': [('border', '1px solid black'),
                                     ('text-align', 'center')]}
])

# df_styled

```

```{python}
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.heatmap(df_skills, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm", linewidths=0.5)
plt.title("Team Skill Levels Heatmap")
plt.xlabel("Technical Skills", fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel("Team Members", fontsize=14)
plt.xticks(rotation=30, fontsize=8)  
plt.yticks(rotation=90, fontsize=8)

# What the Heatmap Shows

When looking at the heatmap it shows that our team still feels relatively new to these technical skills and highlighted in blue are the most notable areas for growth. One person in our group is a Business Analyst while the other two do not use these tools on a daily basis and due to this lack of exposure likely contribute to a lack of technical skill observed in the heatmap. Increased exposure and experience outside of an educational setting could contribute to increased technical skills within the group.

**Data Analysis** represents the strongest skill that our group presents, while this isn't a program it was noted as one of the top skills that impacted salary, alongside experience and being remote. Regardless of the type of data analysis experience, having the ability to analyze data is more vital according to the data represented in the ML Model section of this website. Having a core analytical ability puts our group ahead of most canidates that have vast python experience depending on the types of jobs that they are looking to apply for, and adding the other analytical tools such as Python and PowerBI only empower our group further in the ability to find higher paying jobs.

**PowerBI** is our second strongest skill as a group, and while this isn't a program that is used within the program it was also ranked number 10 when looking at the number times it was mentioned in job descriptions. As can be seen lower on this page it was mentioned 494 times. This is still a strong skill as it can be used in combination with other Microsoft suite programs such as Excel which had a count of 1494 in job descriptions. These in combination with eachother can aid in qualifying for a greater number of jobs. Excel was excluded from the list of skills to conform to size, but is without question also a valuable technical skill.

**Python** is also a strong skill across the team and this is likely in large part due to the exposure that has occured during this course, while no one in the group are experts in Python our technical skill levels indicate that we have a foundational understanding of the programming language and are able to navigate the complexities and manipulate data in order to meet organizational goals and objectives required for data analysis, automation, and model development that was observed during this course. 

**Cloud Computing** was one of the areas where we struggled as a group and this was in large part due to a lack of exposure and could likely increase in environments where this was utilized similar to our educational environment like this class.

# Most in demand skills ranked

# Skill Key Words
import pandas as pd

# 1️⃣ Define the skills you want to look for

# Unique color per bar
colors = plt.cm.tab10(np.linspace(0, 1, len(skills)))

# Plot vertical bars
bars = plt.bar(skills, counts, color=colors, edgecolor="black")

# Addressing Skill Gaps

When looking at our groups skill gaps, the group should focus on our weakest points which are cloud computing and machine learning. Each group member can enroll in free online certifications such as certifications that were taken in this course that can enable learning about the systems that would be used like AWS or machine learning platforms. These platforms often provide trainings for little to no cost, and while attending a university can obtain discounts in order to obtain the certifications that would be required to enable jobs that would result in more exposure to amplify the skills to increase the proficiency for each individual in the group. AWS Certifications hold a majority of the market because of their market share, and starting with 

(Refine this, look at AWS classes and list what they can provide and how much they would cost, which ones are the most beneficial)

# Comparing Top Job Market Skills

When looking at the most important skill gaps to consider in terms of the job market, we compared our average skills (last column of the heatmap) with the most in demand across all job descriptions within the dataset. This revealed that we should focus on improving our abilities in data analysis, along with python. While our group has had some introductory knowledge into Python in this class there are still advances that could be made in order to continue to grow and become proficient and employable at a high level. Below are two charts that break down the teams skills average skills vs the same skills that are in demand within the data set provided for this assignment.
