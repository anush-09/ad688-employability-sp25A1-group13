# Team Dataframe

Our team conducted  an overview of our current technical skills when it comes to Business Analytics and our skill levels. The goal was to understand where the group's strengths and weaknesses were, and understand how the data that was collected could relate to the data that was observed in the research conducted. This was used to identify strengths and weaknesses for the group while also identifying potential gaps within the group.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Extended skills data
skills_data = {
    "Name": ["Anu", "Cindy", "Gavin"],
    "Python": [5, 3, 4],
    "SQL": [4, 2, 5],
    "Machine Learning": [3, 1, 4],
    "Cloud Computing": [2, 2, 3],
    "Excel": [5, 4, 5],
    "Tableau": [4, 3, 4],
    "Power BI": [3, 2, 4],
    "R": [3, 1, 4]
}

# Create DataFrame and set index
df_skills = pd.DataFrame(skills_data).set_index("Name")

# Ensure all columns are numeric
df_skills = df_skills.apply(pd.to_numeric)

# Add average skill score across all tools
df_skills["Average_Skill"] = df_skills.mean(axis=1)

# Style with borders and centered text
df_styled = df_skills.style.set_table_styles([
    {'selector': 'th, td', 'props': [('border', '1px solid black'),
                                     ('text-align', 'center')]}
])

df_styled

```

```{python}
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
sns.heatmap(df_skills, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm", linewidths=0.5)
plt.title("Team Skill Levels Heatmap")
plt.show()
